.SH NAME
.sp
\fBvnclicense\fP \- VNC\(rg Server offline licensing utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBvnclicense\fP [\fIOPTION\fP\&...] \fICOMMAND\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBvnclicense\fP applies an offline license to VNC Server, and performs
related auxiliary operations. Visit
\fI\%https://www.realvnc.com/docs/faq/#licensing\fP for more on
licensing.
.sp
Run \fBvnclicense \-add FILE\fP as root to apply an offline license file.  This
operation can also be performed via the VNC Server user interface.  \fBFILE\fP
must be an offline license file obtained from RealVNC (usually with a \fB\&.lic\fP
extension).  The file is copied to \fB/etc/vnc/licenses/vncserver/vnc.lic\fP\&.
.sp
If VNC Server is hosted on a network share, you should instead copy the offline
license file to \fB<install\-dir>/vnc/licenses/vncserver/vnc.lic\fP, where
\fB<install\-dir>\fP is the directory where the executables are installed.  Run
\fBvnclicense \-reload\fP to cause running instances of VNC Server to apply the
new license.
.sp
Note that if VNC Server in Service Mode has been licensed online by signing in
to a RealVNC account then it ignores any offline license.
.SH COMMANDS
