.SH NAME
.sp
\fBvncserver\-x11\fP \- VNC\(rg Server in User Mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBvncserver\-x11\fP [\fIOPTION\fP\&...]
.sp
\fBvncserver\-x11\fP [\fIMODE\fP] [\fIOPTION\fP\&...] \fICOMMAND\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBvncserver\-x11\fP starts VNC Server in User Mode, to allow the desktop of the
currently\-logged on user to be remoted to VNC Viewer on another computer.  When
this user is logged out, VNC Server automatically stops; all VNC Viewer users
are disconnected, and cannot reconnect.  Note that a suitable offline license
is required; see \fBvnclicense(1)\fP\&.
.sp
Run \fBvncserver\-x11\fP to start VNC Server and wait for connections.  A user
interface consisting of a status dialog and, if supported by the window
manager, a status icon is displayed, providing connectivity information and
convenient access to features such as file transfer and chat.  The status
dialog shows information about how to connect and authenticate from VNC Viewer
on another computer.
.sp
Note that an instance of \fBvncserver\-x11\fP is automatically started (as
the root user) by VNC Server in Service Mode; see
\fBvncserver\-x11\-serviced(1)\fP\&.
.sp
\fBvncserver\-x11\fP consumes one computer \(aqdesktop\(aq from your subscription.  See
\fBvnclicense(1)\fP for how to check licensing details.
.SH COMMANDS
.sp
Applying a command to \fBvncserver\-x11\fP performs an auxiliary operation
instead of starting VNC Server.
.sp
To see a list of valid commands, run \fBvncserver\-x11 \-help\fP\&.
.SH MODE
.sp
To apply a \fICOMMAND\fP to the privileged instance of \fBvncserver\-x11\fP started by
VNC Server in Service Mode, run the command as root and specify \fB\-service\fP\&.
.sp
Otherwise, commands apply automatically to VNC Server in User Mode.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Options are parameters, used to configure VNC Server, and also the
following:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-iconnect HOST[::PORT]\fP
Establishes a reverse connection to a Listening VNC Viewer on HOST
at PORT (5500 by default). See \fBvncviewer(1)\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-newinstance\fP
Starts a new instance of VNC Server, providing your subscription
permits; see \fBvnclicense(1)\fP\&.
By default, running \fBvncserver\-x11\fP a second time interacts with
the first instance.
.TP
.B \fB\-showstatus\fP
Displays the status dialog and status icon. This may be useful to
force display in some desktop environments.
.TP
.B \fB\-vncconfigfile FILE\fP
For convenience, if you have many parameters to specify at the
command line, populate a text file (one parameter per line; omit the
dash) and reference it using this flag.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To see a list of valid parameters, run \fBvncserver\-x11 \-help\fP\&.
.SH VNC CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
Parameters can be specified as command line \fIOPTIONS\fP, but
preferably in VNC configuration files. VNC configuration files are
available for:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
All programs, or just VNC Server
.IP \(bu 2
All users of the computer, or just the user starting VNC Server
.IP \(bu 2
Policy, in order to lock down VNC Server
.UNINDENT
.sp
When VNC Server starts, parameters are applied in the following
order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
System\-wide VNC configuration files
.IP 2. 3
Per\-user VNC configuration files
.IP 3. 3
Command line \fIOPTIONS\fP
.IP 4. 3
Policy VNC configuration files
.UNINDENT
.sp
This means that a particular parameter specified at the command line
overrides the same parameter specified in a per\-user or in a system\-wide
VNC configuration file, but is itself overridden by the same parameter
specified in a policy VNC configuration file. Policy cannot be changed
by users.
.sp
Note there is a disadvantage to specifying parameters at the command
line: parameters cannot be reloaded while VNC Server is running. VNC
configuration files \fIcan\fP be reloaded, however, which means that VNC
Server can be reconfigured without downtime.
.sp

\fI\%https://www.realvnc.com/docs/configure\-vnc.html#configure\-vnc\-files\fP
.SH LOGGING
.sp
By default, \fBvncserver\-x11\fP logs basic activity to file at
\fI$HOME/.vnc/vncserver\-x11.log\fP\&.
.sp
To change the log quality, quantity, or destination, specify the \fBLog\fP,
\fBLogDir\fP, and \fBLogFile\fP parameters.
