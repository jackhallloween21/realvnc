.SH NAME

\fBvncserver\-virtual\fP \- VNC\(rg Server in Virtual Mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBvncserver\-virtual\fP [\fIOPTION\fP\&...] [\fI:DISPLAY\fP]
.sp
\fBvncserver\-virtual\fP [\fIOPTION\fP\&...] \fICOMMAND\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBvncserver\-virtual\fP starts VNC Server in Virtual Mode, to create a
\fIvirtual\fP desktop and provide a dedicated workspace for connected VNC
Viewer(s). A virtual desktop persists until VNC Server is explicitly
stopped, even if the user starting it is logged out, or all VNC Viewers
disconnect. It is entirely independent of the console of the host
computer; neither the desktop of the currently logged on user, nor the
login screen, are available to connected VNC Viewers.  Note that a suitable
offline license is required; see \fBvnclicense(1)\fP\&.
.sp
By default, \fBvncserver\-virtual\fP is the recommended interface to \fBXvnc\fP\&.
\fBvncserver\-virtual\fP passes \fIOPTIONS\fP to \fBXvnc\fP, and in addition runs a
default desktop environment, handles logging, and prompts for a password if the
VNC password authentication scheme is chosen. Note there \fImay\fP be circumstances
in which you need to interact with \fBXvnc\fP directly; see \fBXvnc(1)\fP\&.
.sp
Run \fBvncserver\-virtual\fP to start VNC Server and create a virtual
desktop on the first available display, for example 1. By convention,
this equates to a port number of 5900 + DISPLAY, so in this case port
5901. Note that until you have successfully connected via VNC Viewer, there is
no user interface available for you to work with VNC Server; see \fIOPTIONS\fP
for how to configure VNC Server before it starts. Run \fBvncserver\-virtual
:DISPLAY\fP to start VNC Server on the specified display, if it is available.
.sp
Note that as an alternative VNC Server can be started
automatically to create virtual desktops on demand; see
\fBvncserver\-virtuald(1)\fP\&.
.sp
\fBvncserver\-virtual\fP consumes one computer \(aqdesktop\(aq from your subscription.
See \fBvnclicense(1)\fP for how to check licensing details.
.SH COMMANDS
.sp
Applying one of the following commands to \fBvncserver\-virtual\fP performs
an auxiliary operation instead of starting VNC Server:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-clean\fP
Deletes any \fI/tmp/.X11\-unix\fP directory and \fI/tmp/.X<num>\fP
files that may persist if VNC Server is stopped abruptly.
.TP
.B \fB\-help\fP
Shows a help summary.
.TP
.B \fB\-kill :DISPLAY\fP
Stops VNC Server, disconnecting all VNC Viewers, and destroying the
virtual desktop on DISPLAY.
.TP
.B \fB\-list\fP
Shows a list of \fIOPTIONS\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-test\fP
Test mode. The environment and any \fIOPTIONS\fP are tested, and the
expected command is printed rather than executed. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vncserver\-virtual \-test :1 \-config=/my/Xvnc/options
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
verifies that display 1 is available, checks that the \fI/my/Xvnc/options\fP
file contains only valid Xvnc options in the correct format for the
X server, prints the command, and exits.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that other commands are available to perform operations on
\fIexisting\fP virtual desktops, but these must be applied to \fBXvnc\fP;
see \fBXvnc(1)\fP\&.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Options can be any combination of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Parameters, used to configure VNC Server. Run \fBvncserver\-virtual
\-list\fP and examine the output at the bottom. Note it is preferable to
specify parameters in \fI\%VNC configuration files\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Xvnc options, used to configure the built\-in X server. Run
\fBvncserver\-virtual \-list\fP and examine the output at the top, and see
\fBXserver(1)\fP for more information on shared options. Note it may be
more convenient to specify Xvnc options in \fI\%Xvnc configuration files\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
The following additional Xvnc options, which may also be specified in
\fI\%Xvnc configuration files\fP:
.INDENT 2.0
.TP
.B \fB\-blackpixel N\fP
Specifies the pixel value for black.
.TP
.B \fB\-config FILE\fP
Loads Xvnc options from FILE (one per line, in the format
expected by the X server) instead of those in \fI$HOME/.vnc/config\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-depth D\fP
Specifies the pixel depth in bits of the virtual desktop. The
default is 16; alternatives are 8, 15, and 24.
.TP
.B \fB\-geometry WxH\fP
Specifies the size of the virtual desktop. The default is
1024x768.
.TP
.B \fB\-iconnect HOST[::PORT]\fP
Establishes a reverse connection to a Listening VNC Viewer on
HOST at PORT (5500 by default). See \fBvncviewer(1)\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-linebias N\fP
Adjusts thin line pixelization.
.TP
.B \fB\-pixdepths list\-of\-int\fP
Supports the given list of pixmap depths.
.TP
.B \fB\-pixelformat FMT\fP
Specifies the pixel format (RGBnnn or BGRnnn). The default for
depth 8 is to use a colormap (palette); the default for depth 16
is RGB565 and for depth 24, RGB888.
.TP
.B \fB\-screen N WxHxD [XxY]\fP
Sets the width, height, depth, and origin of screen N.
.TP
.B \fB\-showstatus\fP
Causes the VNC Server status dialog to be displayed to connected
VNC Viewers (the dialog is hidden by default).
.TP
.B \fB\-vncconfigfile FILE\fP
For convenience, if you have many parameters to specify at
the command line, populate a text file (one parameter per line;
omit the dash) and reference it using this flag.
.TP
.B \fB\-whitepixel N\fP
Specifies the pixel value for white.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
The following special options, which must NOT be specified in \fI\%Xvnc
configuration files\fP:
.INDENT 2.0
.TP
.B \fB\-config FILE\fP
Loads Xvnc options from FILE (one per line, in the format
expected by the X server) instead of those in
\fI$HOME/.vnc/config\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-nocheckpasswd\fP
Does not prompt for a password if the VNC password authentication
scheme is chosen.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH VNC CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
Parameters can be specified as command line \fIOPTIONS\fP, but
preferably in VNC configuration files. VNC configuration files are
available for:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
All programs, or just VNC Server
.IP \(bu 2
All users of the computer, or just the user starting VNC Server
.IP \(bu 2
Policy, in order to lock down VNC Server (suitable subscription
required)
.UNINDENT
.sp
When VNC Server starts, parameters are applied in the following
order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
System\-wide VNC configuration files
.IP 2. 3
Per\-user VNC configuration files
.IP 3. 3
Command line \fIOPTIONS\fP
.IP 4. 3
Policy VNC configuration files
.UNINDENT
.sp
This means that a particular parameter specified at the command line
overrides the same parameter specified in a per\-user or in a system\-wide
VNC configuration file, but is itself overridden by the same parameter
specified in a policy VNC configuration file. Policy cannot be changed
by users.
.sp
Note there is a disadvantage to specifying parameters at the command
line: parameters cannot be reloaded while VNC Server is running. VNC
configuration files \fIcan\fP be reloaded, however, which means that VNC
Server can be reconfigured without downtime.
.sp

\fI\%https://www.realvnc.com/docs/configure\-vnc.html#configure\-vnc\-files\fP
.SH XVNC CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
Xvnc options can be specified as command line \fIOPTIONS\fP, or in Xvnc
configuration files:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To specify Xvnc options for all users of the computer, create
\fI/etc/vnc/config.custom\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
To specify Xvnc options for a particular user, create
\fI$HOME/.vnc/config\fP (though see also the \fB\-config\fP flag).
.UNINDENT
.sp
For more information, see
\fI\%https://www.realvnc.com/docs/configure\-xvnc.html\fP
.sp
Note if you specify the same Xvnc option in multiple locations there is
no guarantee which will actually take effect.
.SH X STARTUP SCRIPT
.sp
By default, \fBvncserver\-virtual\fP runs \fI/etc/vnc/xstartup\fP to select
a desktop environment for the virtual desktop. You may want to choose
a different desktop environment, or run particular applications:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
To make changes for all users of the computer, create
\fI/etc/vnc/xstartup.custom\fP\&. If this file exists, the default script
is not run.
.IP \(bu 2
To make changes for a particular user, create \fI$HOME/.vnc/xstartup\fP\&.
If this file exists, no system\-wide script is run for that user.
.UNINDENT
.SH SUPPORTED DESKTOP ENVIRONMENTS
.sp
The Xorg server built\-in to VNC Server may have different capabilities to
the system Xorg server; most notably, hardware acceleration might not be
available. For this reason, some desktop environments (particularly
those with a reliance on graphical effects) may not work.
.sp
For a better user experience out\-of\-the\-box on some distributions
(particularly Red Hat), run \fBvncserver\-virtual\fP in conjunction with the
system Xorg server. More desktop environments and applications will likely
be compatible. For more information on this alternative implementation, see
\fI\%https://support.realvnc.com/knowledgebase/article/View/546\fP
.SH ADDITIONAL FILES
.sp
\fBvncserver\-virtual\fP creates \fI$HOME/.vnc/HOST:DISPLAY.pid\fP, containing
the process ID of the virtual desktop. This file is required for the
\fB\-kill\fP command.
.SH LOGGING
.sp
By default, \fBvncserver\-virtual\fP logs basic activity to Standard Error,
and automatically redirects it to file at \fI$HOME/.vnc/HOST:DISPLAY.log\fP\&.
The log output of any applications in the X startup script is also
included.
.sp
To change the log quality, quantity, or destination, specify the \fBLog\fP,
\fBLogDir\fP, and \fBLogFile\fP parameters.
