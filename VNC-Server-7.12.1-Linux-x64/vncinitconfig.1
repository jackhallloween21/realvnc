.SH NAME
.sp
\fBvncinitconfig\fP \- VNC\(rg Server setup utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBvncinitconfig\fP \fIACTION\fP\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBvncinitconfig\fP resets VNC Server to factory defaults, and performs
related auxiliary operations. \fIACTIONS\fP apply to VNC Server in all modes
unless otherwise stated.
.sp
Note that \fBvncinitconfig \-install\-defaults\fP is run
automatically when VNC Server is installed, and numerous files are
created; examine the script for details. If you wish to subsequently
edit these files, it is recommended you do so in parallel \fB\&.custom\fP files;
see the header at the top of each file for more information.
.sp
Note that if you \fIdo\fP edit the original files and subsequently run
\fBvncinitconfig\fP, any changes are overridden but preserved in files
with a \fB\&.old\fP suffix.
.SH ACTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-install\-defaults\fP
Performs all the actions below except \fB\-register\-SELinux\fP,
\fB\-enable\-system\-xorg\fP and \fB\-disable\-system\-xorg\fP,
where supported on the platform. It may be
useful to perform this operation if VNC Server or any auxiliary
application or file becomes corrupted.
.TP
.B \fB\-pam\fP
Creates \fB/etc/pam.d/vncserver\fP or updates \fB/etc/pam.conf\fP,
depending upon the version of PAM installed, to enable system
authentication using PAM. By default, the \fIpam_unix\fP module is
referenced to query passwords against the local database store
only.
.sp
If you wish to query passwords against a directory service such as
LDAP, you must reference an alternative module that provides this
functionality. As a convenience, \fB\-pam\fP additionally lists PAM
modules (such as \fIpam_ldap.so\fP) found on your system; you must
manually create \fB/etc/pam.d/vncserver.custom\fP or edit \fB/etc/pam.conf\fP
to reference such a module.
.sp
Alternatively, for distributions such as Ubuntu with a common PAM
configuration in \fB/etc/pam.d/common\-auth\fP, set
\fB/etc/pam.d/vncserver.custom\fP to:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
@include common\-auth
@include common\-account
@include common\-session
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For distributions such as Red Hat with a common PAM configuration in
\fB/etc/pam.d/password\-auth\fP, set \fB/etc/pam.d/vncserver.custom\fP to:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
auth     include  password\-auth
account  include  password\-auth
session  include  password\-auth
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-xstartup\fP
Creates \fB/etc/vnc/xstartup\fP to run a default virtual desktop
environment for VNC Server in Virtual Mode. See
\fBvncserver\-virtual(1)\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-config\fP
Creates \fB/etc/vnc/config\fP to specify default Xvnc options for
VNC Server in Virtual Mode. See \fBvncserver\-virtual(1)\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-virtual\-pulse\-conf\fP
Creates \fB/etc/vnc/pulse/daemon.conf\fP which will be read by the PulseAudio
sound server when audio is played from within a Virtual Mode session.  This
prevents audio from the virtual sessions being directed to the physical
speakers.
.TP
.B \fB\-virtual\-xorg\-conf\fP
Creates \fB/etc/X11/vncserver\-virtual.conf\fP to configure Xorg when VNC
Server in Virtual Mode is used with SystemXorg enabled.
.TP
.B \fB\-keygen\fP
Regenerates a private key for the root user. This key determines the
identity of VNC Server in Service Mode and of the VNC Server in
Virtual Mode daemon. Note you should ideally find out why the
private key is missing or corrupt before performing this operation.
.TP
.B \fB\-licensing\fP
Clears up old files related to licensing.
.TP
.B \fB\-service\-daemon\fP, \fB\-virtual\-daemon\fP
Installs an init file for the VNC Server in Service Mode or VNC
Server in Virtual Mode daemon respectively. This will be a
SystemV\-style init script or systemd unit file as appropriate. See
\fBvncserver\-x11\-serviced(1)\fP,
\fBvncserver\-virtuald(1)\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-enable\-print\fP
Registers the VNC backend with CUPS, on platforms where the VNC
backend cannot be installed directly in the CUPS directory.
.TP
.B \fB\-firewalld\fP
Install firewalld service configuration files for VNC Service Mode
and Virtual Mode daemons.
.TP
.B \fB\-register\-SELinux\fP
Attempts to register SELinux modules that have been compiled onto the
system. Required for the VNC Server in Service Mode and Virtual Mode
daemons. Note this command is not run as part of \fB\-install\-defaults\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-enable\-system\-xorg\fP
Enables SystemXorg for VNC Server in Virtual Mode. Run as root to enable
for all users, or as a normal user to enable for just that user. When
SystemXorg is enabled, VNC Server in Virtual Mode will use your system\(aqs
installed Xorg instead of Xvnc. Note this command is not run as part of
\fB\-install\-defaults\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-disable\-system\-xorg\fP
Disables SystemXorg for VNC Server in Virtual Mode. Run as root to disable
for all users, or as a normal user to disable for just that user. Note this
command is not run as part of \fB\-install\-defaults\fP\&.
