.SH NAME
.sp
\fBvncserver\-x11\-serviced\fP \- VNC\(rg Server in Service Mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBvncserver\-x11\-serviced\fP [\fIOPTION\fP\&...] [\fICOMMAND\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBvncserver\-x11\-serviced\fP is a daemon that starts VNC Server in Service Mode,
to allow the console desktop of the computer to be remoted to VNC Viewer on
another computer. This may be the desktop of the currently logged\-on user, or
else the login screen. The daemon can be started manually, but is designed to
be started automatically at system boot time; see \fI\%Starting the daemon\fP\&. Note
that the daemon survives a restart of the X server.
.sp
The daemon runs \fBvncserver\-x11\fP as the root user; see \fBvncserver\-x11(1)\fP\&. This means that to work with VNC Server in Service Mode you
actually interact with a privileged instance of the same program as VNC Server
in User Mode; see \fI\%VNC configuration files\fP\&.
.sp
A user interface consisting of a status dialog and, if supported by the window
manager, a status icon is displayed, providing connectivity information and
convenient access to features such as file transfer and chat.  The status
dialog shows information about how to connect and authenticate from VNC Viewer
on another computer.
.sp
\fBvncserver\-x11\-serviced\fP consumes one computer \(aqdesktop\(aq from your
subscription.  See \fBvnclicense(1)\fP for how to check licensing
details.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-fg\fP
Runs in the foreground (not as a daemon), which may be useful for
troubleshooting.
.UNINDENT
.SH VNC CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
To configure VNC Server in Service Mode, specify parameters for the
instance of \fBvncserver\-x11\fP owned by the root user. See
\fBvncserver\-x11(1)\fP for more information.
.SH USER INTERFACE
.sp
Under some window managers, VNC Server is unable to determine the
identity of the current desktop owner, and consequently the VNC Server
user interface (a status dialog and icon) cannot be automatically
displayed. If this is the case, run the following command (as the
desktop owner, not as root):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
vncserverui \-serviceui
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It may be convenient to include this in a user\(aqs \fB\&.xsession\fP file (or
appropriate startup file for the desktop environment).
.SH STARTING THE DAEMON
.sp
A suitable init script should have been installed with VNC Server; see
\fBvncinitconfig(1)\fP\&. To start the daemon manually:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For a Linux distribution using \fBXsystemd\fP, run \fBsystemctl start
vncserver\-x11\-serviced.service\fP
.IP \(bu 2
For a Linux distribution using \fBXinit.d\fP, run
\fB/etc/init.d/vncserver\-x11\-serviced start\fP
.IP \(bu 2
For a Debian\-compatible Linux distribution using \fBXinit.d\fP,
(alternatively) run \fBservice vncserver\-x11\-serviced start\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
To start the daemon automatically at system boot time, use the
appropriate configuration tool for your system:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For a Linux distribution using \fBXsystemd\fP, run \fBsystemctl enable
vncserver\-x11\-serviced.service\fP
.IP \(bu 2
For a Debian\-compatible Linux distribution using \fBXinit.d\fP, run
\fBupdate\-rc.d vncserver\-x11\-serviced defaults\fP
.IP \(bu 2
For a Red Hat\-compatible Linux distribution using \fBXinit.d\fP, run
\fBchkconfig \-\-add vncserver\-x11\-serviced\fP
.UNINDENT
.SH LOGGING
.sp
See \fBvncserver\-x11(1)\fP\&.
.sp
To change the log quality, quantity, or destination, specify the \fBLog\fP,
\fBLogDir\fP, and \fBLogFile\fP parameters.
